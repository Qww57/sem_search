							<h1>Abstract</h1>
							<p> This thesis reviews the use of Natural Logics as a solution to handle semantic search in scientific texts. Various frameworks have been proposed to deal with semantics such as FOL or DL, but their syntax always remains drastically different from natural language. This makes them hardly understandable by inexperienced users, but also rises the problem of an automated translation process from and to these languages. </p>
							
							<p> This thesis tries to over come this problem, by working on Natural Logics, a reasoning framework using natural language as vessel where reasoning can be conducted directly by using rules reflecting intuitive reasoning in natural language. </p> 

							<p> After defining a first approach with limited scope named Core Natural Logics (III), this thesis focuses on defining a set of extensions for Core Natural Language in order to define a grammar and a parser able to cope with most linguistic structures of scientific texts (IV). The thesis especially focuses on defining a domain specific ontological analysis of the concepts in order to avoid syntactic ambiguities and to infer underlying relations between elements of the sentence (V).  
							</p>
							
							<p> An algorithm to decompose Natural Logics propositions into a concept graph representation integrated in the domain ontology is then proposed (VI). This enables Natural Logics to draw complex inferences proofs using graph search and to return the answer in natural language (VII). Finally the correctness of Natural Logics grammar, of its graph decomposition and graph search are assessed (VIII), before discussing Natural Logics current limitations, potential improvements and the related future work (IX). </p>
							
							<p> It is hoped this thesis and the implemented Prolog prototype will demonstrate the reader of the benefits of using Natural Logics as a semantic approach. </p>
